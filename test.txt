Alone at home, very lonely
Encountering the underworld confrontation on the street, it is very shocking
Your parents had new daughter
Your mood is getting lower and lower, trying to commit suicide. Didn't work out.
You're starting elementary school
Your parents didn't take good care of you
You like to have nothing to do, you try to climb over the wall, you die
